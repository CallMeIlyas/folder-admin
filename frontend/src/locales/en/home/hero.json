  "description": "Pop up frames are a type of handicraft that uses stacked paper so it has depth or it looks 3D. Starting from making digital caricatures from real photos, designed with a background according to customer preferences. After that, we print, cut, and assemble the paper layer by layer. Little Amora Caricature has been established since 2018. Our signature design uses vector illustrations, where the body appears smaller and shorter than the head, making the caricature face stand out more attractively."
